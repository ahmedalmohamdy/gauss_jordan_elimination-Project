Gauss-Jordan Elimination
Solve system of equations using Gauss-Jordan elimination method (reduced row echelon form).

Usage
python main.py
The program follow these main steps:

generate user_manual.txt file the teachs the user how to write his equations
the user should create equations.txt file that contains the equations but must follow the schema
when the user is done with his equations he/she type y or Y to continue
the file solution.txt will be created containing the solution which is either of:
No solution
Infinite number of solutions
Only one solution
